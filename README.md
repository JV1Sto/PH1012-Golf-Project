# PH1012-Golf-Project

This program should be somewhat self explanatory. However instructions are included below

The program will begin by asking for a few values. For convienence some commonly needed values have been added. However, you are able to enter your own. 
Once the values are obtained the program will run through about 100,000 different angles between 0 and 90 degrees, testing them by brute force with our model.

The program will then display a graph, and produce a parabolic equation. The equation, best angle predicted by the equation, and best angle found via brute force will all be shown
